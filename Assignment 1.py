Please read! I am sure you will be confused by the fact that there are only twenty or so (out of thousands) pokemon
that are being used. I began this assignment working on this Names section, and actually
got really far by using a completely different idea. That was when I noticed there were still discrepancies and odd
sections that wouldn't cooperate. I had to scratch the entire thing. I know this is a common thing to run into. By the time I got one column of information 
shaved down to fit the data in *another* column, I realized I was working with a lot of missing variables too. I know 
this looks ridiculous, but part of why I'm very excited for this part of Python (datbase management, etc) is because
I know it will come up in every day work if I am fortunate enough to land a job in the tech industry. Additionally, YOu had mentioned
during class that updating someTHING (even if we're unsure) is better than nothing
because you can at least see where I'm trying to go with it...'
